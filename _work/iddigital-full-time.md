After working at ID Digital for over 2 years part time after school and during holidays,
Jay, the director, offered me a full-time position given that I was to be completing year 12.

This was not an easy decision however, I looked forwards to life at university, and having
a full time position as lead developer and studying physics at uni are exclusive options.
Long story short: I accepted this position with the firm decision that I would defer my tertiary
studies for no longer than one year, after all, a year of full time work should be pretty
valuable in the long run, in terms of one's resume that is (which is what I have been told anyway).
