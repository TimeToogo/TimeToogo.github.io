I first began working at [ID Digital Agency][0] for my year 10 work experience.
Later that year I began paid work over the school break and maintained a part time position
after school a few days of the week.

This being not only my first experience in the industry but also my first job,
was unlike anything which I could foresee. For myself there was a profound difference in working for
non-personal projects where I was *told* my task and *required* to fulfil it. The pressure
was at first nerve racking but reduced over time after realising I had the skills necessary
and was able to apply them in a commercial web development environment.
I also enjoy the experience, working with like minded others and the additional feelings
of self-worth and independence which are intrinsic with maintaining a paid job.

I have learnt invaluable lessons from my time at ID Digital. Becoming confident with some
industry standard tools and processes which are not applicable to personal work has
afforded me confidence in my own work and knowledge.
