Before I knew about the likes of Twitter, Reddit or such, back in early 2012, I had an idea for
a website where anyone can post anything for anyone over the internet. This idea evolved to become
"NetYelp". Due to hosting costs and availability I was coerced into learning PHP for the website's development.
Soon enough I had learnt the ins and outs of all that goes with web development including: JS, CSS, MySql.

The goal of the site was to be as open as possible therefore user accounts were not required to post a message.
Messages are time based, they can be scheduled for a specific date and time in which it will be displayed.
This feature brought forth a few technical details such as the time being different across the world. Timezones
presented a problem, but it was decided that if message was scheduled and 3:15 PM, that is when it would be
shown for everyone. Therefore IP-Geolocation was used to ensure the appropriate messages are displayed.

This was an enjoyable project from a technical and educational point of view. Today it still remains
online and can be found here:
