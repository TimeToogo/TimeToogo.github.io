In primary school, from around grade 3 to 4, my friend had introduced me to powerpoint games.
I learnt that I am not only able to play them but I can *make* them as well. And for the first time,
I was able to turn my own ideas into working and playable games. As you could imagine, this was an exciting revelation
for myself at that age. Today I see this as a defining point in my life, the genesis of my creations, these games
wired together through nothing more than basic animations and hyperlinks had opened a new world of creativity.

These games mainly consist of moving your cursor through mazes or out of the way of obstacles,
but nevertheless are still fun. I imagine they would make hilarious drinking games as well.

Here are the semi-finished powerpoint games:
