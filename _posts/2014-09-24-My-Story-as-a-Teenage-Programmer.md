My name is Elliot Levin and this is my story of becoming a teenage programmer.

Looking back through memories of my life so far, if there is one distinction to be made,
it is that I enjoyed making things. Even when I was a young child, I took to drawing as an
outlet of creativity. Growing up, becoming increasingly capable, I was drawn to other avenues,
most notably in my mind is when I learnt how to [make games using powerpoint][0]. Even just
discovering how to utilise its most basic tools like animations and hyperlinks that had opened
an entire realm of possibilities. So naturally when I was first introduced to programming, I
became obsessed.

The journey to becoming skilled in the seemingly magical realm of programming was an interesting task
for myself at the age of 12 and onwards. With little guidance, I had relied on myself and the internet to 
learn the necessary skills. Throughout the endeavor, there have been distinguishable phases of this journey so far.

The first and most challenging being learning an entirely foreign way of thinking.
It was no longer possible to rely on my parents, teachers and those around me,
it had ultimately come down to sheer perseverance and practice. With every project I had
started I ran into small logical problems which I initially deemed unsolvable, they were
not issues which I could simply search up and solve. In my mind they were too specific and I had not
the ability to even ask the right questions. Though with persistent thought, I had often been subject
to the epiphany, the 'Aha!' moment where everything just falls into place. Over time these stumping
problems become fewer and further between until a point in time, which I cannot distinguish, where my
problems had not longer stemmed from flawed thinking but from lack of knowledge. And with these problems 
I was able to utilise tools like Google, Stack Overflow and the world of programmers that have already had 
my question answered long ago.

From this point on I had been able to write programs to fulfil the most of my ideas. But sooner
rather than later, I came upon another set of questions. These questions stemmed from the desire
not only to code, but to code *well*. Up until this point I being writing programs that only worked
with no thought to future use or maintainability as they were built simply to fulfil a goal.
With the desire to build more elaborate applications, came the question, "How can I write maintainable code?".
Answering this was almost was different kind of challenge that I had not previously been faced with. Suddenly
logic became decreasingly relevant, there was no longer a *correct* answer, but instead
a range of differing *opinions*. So how to decipher this mess? For myself there was only one way,
from experience. I often attempted to apply various techniques or patterns to my work, for a while
doing so religiously where it often created more problems than it solved. Over time, my conclusion was
that having a *clear specification* was perhaps the most important part building a maintainable application,
allowing one to accurately determine the trade-offs and benefits to the various design decisions.

Until this point, my work was often personal. Projects that were not often shared with many others.
It was now, when I wanted to start building things that could be shared with others that could possibly find
the work useful. So I began looking into open source software. I became familiar with websites such as
GitHub, which had allowed me to openly publish my projects for the community as well as contributing to
other projects.

It was about this time that I had began my first paid work as a part time web developer. This was
a completely new experience for myself as I could observe and interact with other individuals in
the industry. This was an invaluable lesson to myself as I learnt that in business things are often far
from ideal. People have to make compromises to fulfil there jobs in a timely manner.
Such practices which I considered integral to maintainability either non existent or even unheard of
to other full time programmers. But with that said, there is the positive aspect where the people are
willing to improve, invest in learning and strive to be better. And for myself, I was learning to adapt,
such as with legacy code where best practices are often not applicable. 

The journey to where I am now has not come without some negatives. The time consuming nature of
my work has often had an impact on other aspects of my life. In the later years of high school,
I have been finding it increasingly troublesome to balance my personal work with my schooling, 
sport and other activities. At this age when I feel as though I have had the most projects and ideas, 
I am finding the least amount of time to dedicate myself towards them. It is disappointing how
this part of life, perhaps the most educational, has been completely segregated from my schooling and
remains completely irrelevant to all my subjects (to be fair, I did not choose IT as a subject
because I was not interested being told how use HTML). It has also been troubling socially, being unable
to relate such a large part of my life with any of my friends at school is difficult. 

Nevertheless, so far I have few regrets in the position that I am as of today. This gift has allowed
me to perceive my world from a perspective which I wish more had the opportunity to share.
I also feel privileged to be able to be working in a skilled position at my age. And finally,
I wish that a subject which just introduces the basics of programming could be introduced into the
education system. I cannot but believe that there are many others out there who would just 
need a taste to be hooked as I was and as I continue to be.

Thanks for reading.
